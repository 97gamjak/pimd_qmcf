The moldescriptor file is used to assign every atom in the system to a molecular unit. These molecular units are numbered consecutively starting 
from 1 and are given in the third column of the ``.rst`` file as described in the :ref:`restartFile` section. Providing a moldescriptor file is
optional, but becomes mandatory if pressure coupling is enabled *via* the :ref:`pressureCouplingKeys` in the ``.in`` file. The structure of the
moldescriptor file is as follows:
